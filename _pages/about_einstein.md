My name is Hao, a tech lover and I was proudly born in Viet Nam. I am currently completing my final semester at Vietnam National University - University of Engineering and Technology. I am also working as an embedded software engineer at FPT Software. My hobby is reading books, travelling and playing LOL with my friends. Glad to see you here! 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
